I obtained the data from the supporting information in the article: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pld3.180

PDF with supplementary information used:

[Suplementary information JA levels.pdf](https://github.com/csgomez17/JA_levels/files/10901842/Suplementary.information.JA.levels.pdf)

Figure to reproduce (Fig 1):

I downloaded the pdf and transefered the data from table 2 to an excel sheet that I labeled Plant_Raw_Data.xlxs

[Plant_Raw_Data.xlsx](https://github.com/Intro-Sci-Comp-UIowa/biol-4386-course-project-csgomez17/files/11358202/Plant_Raw_Data.xlsx)

I did deleted the "tip" after L1P8, L6P8 and L8P10 since it was specifiedd only thsoe were used and i wanted the x-axis to match the original graph.

Then I converted this file into a csv file to be able to use it for R.
 [Plant_Raw_Data.csv](https://github.com/Intro-Sci-Comp-UIowa/biol-4386-course-project-csgomez17/files/11358203/Plant_Raw_Data.csv)


All of this was done on 04/27/2023
