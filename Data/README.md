I obtained the data from the supporting information in the article: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pld3.180

PDF with supplementary information used:

[Suplementary information JA levels.pdf](https://github.com/csgomez17/JA_levels/files/10901842/Suplementary.information.JA.levels.pdf)

Figure to reproduce (Fig 1):

I downloaded the pdf and transefered the data from table 2 to an excel sheet that I labeled JA.xlxs

[JA (1).xlsx](https://github.com/csgomez17/JA_levels/files/10901844/JA.1.xlsx)

Then I converted this file into a csv file to be able to use it for R.
[JA .csv](https://github.com/csgomez17/JA-levels-in-developmental-transition/files/10911829/JA.csv)


All of this was done on 02/28/2023
