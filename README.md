Introduction: 

In early plant development we have different hormones acting at different stages, driving the development of the shoot, leading to flowering. One of the hormones abundant in this juvenile phase compared to adult maize is Jasmonic acid (JA) and Gibberellic acid (GA). These two hormones are responsible for growth and to redirecting metabolism. Jasmonic acid is part of the Jamonates (JAs), a class of plant hormones that play essential roles in response to tissue wounding.  Methyl jasmonate (meJA) is one of the forms of JA and is key for its ability to response to stress, like drought, salinity changes and heat. Previous studies have shown that application of JA on developing plants extends the juvenile phase and delays the decline in miR156 levels. miR156 plays a key role in biological processes, including developmental and metabolic regulation, it generates leaf formation. 

What roles does jasmonic acid levels have in the transition to the adult phase in maize? In order to test if the addition of JA promotes joviality, JA and MeJA levels were measured in successive stages of leaf development, and in later leaves in normal and mutant maize. Gibberellic acid was measured along with JA and MeJA, showing that JA levels increased from germination through leaf one differentiation. Later declining in leaves as the shoot approached phase change. Findings showed that the levels of GA were low in leaf one after germination and increased as the shoot matured to the adult phase. After multiple does of exogenous JA were given, as many as three additional juvenile leaves were produced. Suggesting the key role of JA in new leaf production and joviality. Quantifying these key hormones in phase change mutants provided insight into how these two hormones control phase-specific patterns of differentiation in early development. Concluding that JA is a leaf-provisioned signal, affecting duration (and likely initiation) of juvenile phase maize. The figure to be replicated shows the relationship between successive developmental time points and the hormones expressed. This shows there is a change of hormones as the leaf transitions into a mature stage, with meJA/JA being highly expressed in later stages on an early leaf. However there is also a low expression of these hormones in older leaves, which have different growth and allocation of molecules.

Values are shown as means of three to six biological replicates. gFW, grams fresh weight. * indicates significant difference of previous developmental stage using unpaired students t test p < .05, ** indicates p < .01. ‡ indicates significant difference compared with L1P8, p < .05. ‡‡ indicates p < .01 

This figure shows the endogenous concentration of JA, meJA, and GA at different successive developmental time points. L# shows the leaf formed, and the P# is the plastochron (developmental stage name). Combined this shows the different leaves as the plant grows and the developmental stage of each leave, we then look at the hormones expressed in each of these time points. We can see that JA and meJA are expressed highly at the first leaf at the later stages of development while in early development, all three hormones are found in similar levels. In the later leaves we see a switch, and GA is more present in later leaves in later developmental stages. 

Materials and Methods: 

    The experiments: 

Plants were grown to show leaves 1–4 displayed only juvenile traits, leaves 5–7 were transition leaves, with the remaining leaves displaying adult characteristics. Then the emerging seedlings were treated with 100 μl of 5 mM JA in 5% ethanol at the apical whorl on 2 day intervals. Ear and tassel emergence were scored by counting leaves below the inflorescences. To measure the hormones the protocol from Pan, Welti, and Wang (2010) was used. Hormones were extracted from 100 mg pooled fresh leaf tissue at desired developmental time points. Tissue samples were harvested at the same time each day to consider the circadian variations in hormone levels. These tissue extracts were then purified with dichloromethane, dried, and resuspended in methanol. Hormone levels in each extract were determined using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (Acquity H-Class UPLC—Waters TQD).
